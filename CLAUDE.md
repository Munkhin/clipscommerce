# Next Steps Roadmap for ClipsCommerce

## 1. Core Application
- Finalize authentication flows (multi-provider OAuth, 2FA, secure password reset).
- Complete RBAC roles/permissions enforcement across all APIs and UI routes.
- Enforce usage-limit checks at the middleware layer and surface overruns clearly in the dashboard.

## 2. Dashboard & UX
- Polish all dashboard subsections (`Accelerate`, `AI`, `Autopost`, `Competitor Tactics`, etc.) for consistent look and feel.
- Wire real analytics data into charts and tables; remove placeholder mocks.
- Add in-app tour and contextual tooltips for first-time users.

## 3. Autoposting Workflow
- Finish queue/scheduler service for exact-time publishing across supported platforms.
- Implement retry/back-off logic with exponential delays and failure notifications.
- Provide UI to edit, pause or cancel scheduled posts.

## 4. AI & ML Modules
- Integrate `LightGBMModel` scoring for engagement prediction in real-time content suggestions.
- Build continuous fine-tuning pipeline using latest performance metrics.
- Ship A/B testing hooks to compare model variants inside production traffic.

## 5. Analytics & Reporting
- Complete `/api/analytics/reports` endpoints and connect to dashboard downloads.
- Generate PDF/CSV export options for key reports.
- Add cohort, funnel and retention visualizations.

## 6. Billing & Monetization
- Finalize Stripe webhooks for subscription lifecycle events and usage-based overages.
- Display upcoming invoice + credit usage inside `Settings → Billing`.
- Introduce in-app upgrade prompts tied to feature gates.

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Expand Playwright end-to-end coverage for critical user journeys (sign-up → first post).
- Add unit tests for all services lacking coverage; target 85 %+ overall.
- Integrate accessibility regression tests (axe-core) into CI.

## 8. DevOps & Infrastructure
- Automate database migrations in deployment workflow.
- Harden CI/CD pipeline with static analysis, secret scanning and supply-chain checks.
- Roll out blue-green deployments with automatic rollback on failures.

## 9. Documentation
- Publish OpenAPI specification and host interactive docs under `/api-docs`.
- Write developer onboarding guide covering local setup, coding standards and release process.
- Maintain user-facing knowledge base for common workflows and troubleshooting.

## 10. Performance & Reliability
- Introduce caching layer for heavy analytics queries (Redis or similar).
- Apply circuit-breaker pattern to external API integrations to prevent cascading failures.
- Instrument detailed telemetry and set SLO alerts for latency and error rates.

## 11. Security & Compliance
- Conduct full security audit (OWASP top-10, penetration testing).
- Enforce CSRF protection and strict rate-limiting on all endpoints.
- Review Supabase policies and ensure least-privilege defaults.

## 12. Future Enhancements
