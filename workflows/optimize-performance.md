# Workflow: Optimizing Performance

This workflow outlines a systematic approach to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in the application.

## 1. Identify Bottlenecks

*   **Profiling:** Use browser developer tools (Lighthouse, Performance tab) for frontend profiling. For backend, use Node.js profilers or Supabase query performance insights.
*   **Monitoring:** Analyze metrics from Vercel, Supabase, and any APM tools for slow requests, high CPU/memory usage, or long database query times.
*   **User Feedback:** Pay attention to user reports about slow loading times or unresponsive UI.
*   **Code Review:** Identify potential performance anti-patterns (e.g., N+1 queries, excessive re-renders, large bundle sizes).

## 2. Analyze and Diagnose

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Bundle Size:** Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies.
    *   **Component Re-renders:** Use React DevTools to pinpoint unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Check for unoptimized images.
    *   **Network Requests:** Analyze waterfall charts for slow API calls or too many requests.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Database Queries:** Examine slow query logs in Supabase. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for complex queries.
    *   **API Latency:** Profile API routes to find slow operations.
    *   **Caching:** Identify opportunities for caching frequently accessed data.
*   **General:**
    *   **Algorithmic Complexity:** Review algorithms for inefficient operations (e.g., nested loops on large datasets).

## 3. Implement Optimizations

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Code Splitting/Lazy Loading:** Implement dynamic imports for components and routes.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js `Image` component, compress images.
    *   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Virtualization:** For long lists, use libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
    *   **CSS Optimization:** Purge unused CSS with Tailwind CSS.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Database Indexing:** Add appropriate indexes to frequently queried columns.
    *   **Query Optimization:** Rewrite inefficient SQL queries.
    *   **Caching:** Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
    *   **Batching/Debouncing:** Reduce the number of API calls.
*   **General:**
    *   **Reduce Network Payload:** Send only necessary data.
    *   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)/Static Site Generation (SSG):** Leverage Next.js rendering strategies where appropriate.

## 4. Test and Verify Performance Improvements

*   **Before/After Benchmarking:** Measure performance metrics before and after applying optimizations.
*   **Load Testing:** Simulate high traffic to ensure scalability.
*   **E2E Tests:** Ensure existing functionality is not broken.
    ```bash
    npx playwright test
    ```
*   **Lighthouse/Web Vitals:** Re-run performance audits.

## 5. Deploy and Monitor

*   Deploy the optimized code.
*   Continuously monitor performance metrics in production to ensure the improvements are sustained and no new bottlenecks emerge.
