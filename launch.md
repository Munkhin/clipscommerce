### **1. Testing & Bug Fixes**

**Context:** A robust testing foundation is essential to prevent regressions and ensure a quality user experience. The project has a history of test failures, particularly in critical areas like the payment flow. The E2E (end-to-end) suite serves as the final quality gate and must be comprehensive and stable.

**Instructions:**
- [x] **Address Existing Failures:**
  - Analyze `test-failure-summary.md` and the corresponding screenshots/logs to understand the root cause of each documented failure.
  - Prioritize and fix the bugs that led to these test failures.

- [ ] **Stabilize Payment Flow Tests:**
  - Review `src/__tests__/payment-flow.test.tsx` and `src/__tests__/payment-flow-simple.test.tsx`.
  - **NOTE:** Unable to add new tests for declined payments, retries, subscription changes, and coupon codes due to tooling issues. Existing tests will be run as part of the full regression.

- [ ] **Finalize E2E Test Suite:**
  - Audit the entire `e2e/` directory. Ensure that tests cover the most critical user journeys: user registration/login, dashboard interaction, creating and managing clips, and account settings.
  - Validate the Playwright configuration in `playwright.simple.config.ts` to ensure it runs efficiently and reliably against the production-like environment.

- [ ] **Execute Full Regression:**
  - Run the entire test suite, including all Jest unit/integration tests (`npm test`) and the full Playwright E2E suite (`npx playwright test`).
  - Debug and resolve any and all failures until the entire suite passes with 100% reliability. No failing tests are acceptable for launch.

### **2. Backend & Database**

**Context:** The backend has architectural ambiguities, including the use of both Prisma and a custom Supabase client, which can lead to data inconsistencies and maintenance overhead. Database setup scripts are fragmented, and new features (AI, Autoposting) have defined schemas but may lack complete backend logic.

**Instructions:**
- [x] **Consolidate Database Strategy:**
  - Analyze all database interactions in the codebase, mapping out where `prisma/` is used versus where `supabase/` is used.
  - Make an architectural decision to unify on a **single** database client.
  - Refactor all data access logic to use the chosen client, removing the other to create a single source of truth for database operations.

- [x] **Unify Database Setup:**
  - Review the three setup scripts: `scripts/setup-database-final.js`, `scripts/setup-database-simple.js`, and `scripts/setup-database.js`.
  - Consolidate them into a **single, idempotent script** that can be run safely in any environment (local, staging, production) to initialize or migrate the database.

- [x] **Implement Core Feature Logic:**
  - Examine the database schemas defined in `supabase/migrations/`.
  - Implement the necessary backend services and API endpoints to power the features that rely on these tables.

- [x] **Secure All Endpoints:**
  - Audit every API route and server-side function.
  - Ensure that every endpoint that mutates data or exposes sensitive information is protected by robust authentication and authorization.

### **3. Frontend & UI/UX**

**Context:** A polished, intuitive, and consistent user interface is critical for user adoption and retention. The UI has known gaps documented in the project's roadmaps, and it must gracefully handle all possible states (loading, error, empty data) to feel professional.

**Instructions:**
- [x] **Implement Roadmap Features:**
  - Thoroughly review `00.workflow/roadmaps/ui_ux_improvements_roadmap.md`.
  - Create a concrete task list from the roadmap items and implement the missing UI components and features.

- [x] **Conduct Full UI/UX Audit:**
  - Manally navigate through the entire application on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  - Identify and fix all inconsistencies in styling (buttons, forms, fonts), spacing, and layout. Ensure the application is fully responsive and usable on all target devices.

- [x] **Implement Application States:**
  - For every page and component that fetches data, implement clear loading indicators (e.g., skeletons, spinners).
  - Implement user-friendly error messages for when API calls or server actions fail. Use the `error.tsx` boundary for unhandled exceptions.
  - Design and implement elegant "empty states" for pages or lists that do not yet have any data.

- [x] **Remove All Placeholders:**
  - Perform a global search for `TODO`, `FIXME`, and placeholder text like "Lorem Ipsum".
  - Replace all placeholders with final, production-ready content, components, and functionality.

### **4. Code Quality & Refactoring**

**Context:** The codebase shows signs of technical debt, including duplicate files, dead code, and overly complex components. Addressing this now will improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and make future development faster and safer.

**Instructions:**
- [x] **Resolve All Code Tags:**
  - Use your IDE's search functionality to find every instance of `// TODO:` and `// FIXME:`.
  - For each tag, either implement the required change or remove the comment if it is no longer relevant.

- [x] **Eliminate Redundant Files:**
  - **`tiktok-query`:** Compare `tiktok-query.js` and `tiktok-query.ts`. The TypeScript file (`.ts`) should be the source of truth. Safely delete the JavaScript file (`.js`) and update any imports to point to the `.ts` version.
  - **`middleware`:** Next.js uses the `middleware.ts` file in the **root** directory. Consolidate any logic from `src/middleware.ts` into the root `middleware.ts` and delete the one in `src/`.

- [x] **Refactor Complex Components:**
  - Identify the largest and most complex components in the `src/` directory.
  - Break them down into smaller, more manageable, single-purpose components to improve readability, testability, and reusability.

- [ ] **Enforce Code Standards:**
  - Run the project's linter (`npm run lint`) and TypeScript compiler (`npm run typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit`).
  - Fix **every single error and warning** reported by these tools. A clean bill of health is required for launch.

### **5. DevOps & Deployment**

**Context:** The project has configurations for production deployment, but they must be rigorously validated to ensure a smooth, secure, and scalable launch. A clearly documented deployment process is critical for consistency and reducing human error.

**Instructions:**
- [x] **Validate Production Configuration:**
  - Scrutinize `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `nginx.prod.conf`.
  - Ensure the Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds for a minimal production image.
  - Verify that Nginx is configured with appropriate security headers, caching policies, and routing rules.
  - Build and run the production environment locally (`docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`) to confirm it works as expected.

- [ ] **Document Deployment Process:**
  - Create a new markdown file named `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
  - Write a clear, step-by-step guide for deploying the application to production. This must include building the image, pushing it to a container registry, and running it on the production server.

- [ ] **Configure Production Environment:**
  - Review `.env.example` to ensure all required environment variables for production are documented.
  - Implement a secure method for managing production secrets (e.g., Doppler, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider's secret manager). Do not commit secrets to the repository.

- [ ] **Implement Logging & Monitoring:**
  - Integrate a production-grade logging service (e.g., Sentry, Datadog, Logtail) to capture errors and application logs.
  - Create a basic health check endpoint (e.g., `/api/health`) that the production infrastructure can use to verify that the application is running and healthy.
