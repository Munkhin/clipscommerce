# ClipsCommerce: Go-To-Market & Launch Plan

**Objective:** To execute a low-cost, high-impact launch that establishes ClipsCommerce as the go-to platform for creator-entrepreneurs, achieving rapid user acquisition and market validation.

---

## 1. Core Messaging & Positioning

Our messaging must be laser-focused on the primary pain point of our target audience: the struggle to create trend-aligned content that drives sales.

*   **Headline:** **Turn TikTok Trends Into Sales. Faster.**
*   **Value Proposition:** ClipsCommerce is an AI-powered command center that transforms trending TikTok content into shoppable videos in seconds. We eliminate the guesswork and busywork, so you can focus on what you do best: creating.
*   **Positioning:** The smartest, fastest way for creators and e-commerce brands to monetize content on social media.

---

## 2. The Marketing Funnel: A Phased Approach

We will execute our plan in three phases, guiding potential users from awareness to becoming active evangelists.

### **Phase 1: Pre-Launch (The Momentum Build)**

**Goal:** Build a waitlist of at least 1,000 qualified leads and onboard 100 beta testers from our core micro-influencer demographic.

**Tactics & Automation:**

1.  **High-Conversion Landing Page:**
    *   **Action:** Create a simple, single-page website showcasing the headline and value proposition. Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) to join the waitlist.
    *   **Tool:** Use a free Carrd.co template or a simple Next.js page hosted on Vercel.

2.  **Waitlist & Email Nurturing:**
    *   **Action:** Embed an email capture form on the landing page. Send bi-weekly updates to the waitlist, teasing features and sharing "behind-the-scenes" content to build anticipation.
    *   **Tool:** Use **Tally.so** (free tier for forms) integrated with **Mailchimp** (free tier up to 500 contacts) or **Brevo** (free tier up to 300 emails/day).

3.  **Founder-Led Content Seeding (Show, Don't Tell):**
    *   **Action:** Create a dedicated TikTok account for ClipsCommerce. Use our own tool to create and post 2-3 videos daily that demonstrate the "Trend-to-Template" engine in action. Show how quickly we can jump on a new trend.
    *   **Tool:** **CapCut** (free) for any final video touch-ups.

4.  **Targeted Beta-User Outreach (The "100 Influencers" Initiative):**
    *   **Action:** Systematically identify and personally contact 100 micro-influencers on TikTok who are already using TikTok Shop or promoting products.
    *   **Automation Workflow:**
        1.  **Scrape Leads:** Use **PhantomBuster** (free trial available) to scrape profiles of users who have recently used hashtags like `#tiktokshop`, `#ugccreator`, or `#smallbusinessowner`.
        2.  **Track Outreach:** Manage the outreach process in a **Google Sheet** (free).
        3.  **Personalize DMs:** Send a personalized, non-spammy DM: *"Hey [Name], I'm building a tool to help creators like you turn trends into sales faster. I saw your video on [topic] and loved it. We're giving our first 100 users free lifetime access to our Pro plan. Would you be interested in trying it out?"*

5.  **Community Engagement:**
    *   **Action:** The founder/team should spend 30 minutes daily on Twitter and Reddit. Engage in conversations, offer advice, and subtly mention the problem you're solving. Do not spam links.
    *   **Target Subreddits:** r/ecommerce, r/TikTok, r/CreatorEconomy, r/smallbusiness
    *   **Tool:** Use **TweetDeck** (free) to monitor relevant keywords and hashtags.

### **Phase 2: Launch Week (The Splash)**

**Goal:** Drive a surge of sign-ups, create significant buzz in the creator community, and secure a successful Product Hunt launch.

**Tactics & Automation:**

1.  **Product Hunt Launch (Critical):**
    *   **Action:** This is our primary launch event. Prepare all assets (logo, video demo, screenshots, compelling first comment) at least one week in advance.
    *   **Automation:** Use **Buffer** or **Hootsuite** (free tiers) to schedule a full day of social media posts across all channels to drive traffic to the Product Hunt page.

2.  **Activate Beta Users:**
    *   **Action:** A week before launch, email your 100 beta testers. Thank them for their feedback, give them their promised lifetime access, and ask if they'd be willing to share their honest experience on launch day.

3.  **Email & Social Media Blitz:**
    *   **Action:** Announce the launch to the waitlist with a clear CTA to sign up. Publish a coordinated content blitz across TikTok and Twitter.
    *   **Automation:** The pre-scheduled posts from Buffer/Hootsuite will handle this.

### **Phase 3: Post-Launch (The Growth Engine)**

**Goal:** Build a sustainable, low-cost, and automated user acquisition engine.

**Tactics & Automation:**

1.  **Content Marketing & SEO Loop:**
    *   **Action:** Create a blog and consistently publish high-value, SEO-optimized content targeting long-tail keywords.
    *   **Keyword Targets:** "how to sell more on TikTok shop," "best AI tools for video creators," "how to find trending sounds on TikTok."
    *   **Tools:** Use **Google Keyword Planner** (free) and **AnswerThePublic** (free tier) for topic ideation.
    *   **Content Repurposing (Automation Hub):**
        *   **Trigger:** A new blog post is published (via webhook from CMS).
        *   **Automation:** Utilize the n8n workflow provided below to automate content repurposing.
        *   **Workflow Overview:**
            1.  **New Blog Post Webhook:** Receives a webhook when a new blog post is published.
            2.  **Generate Social Media Copy (ChatGPT):** Uses the blog post content to generate drafts for Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts, and TikTok video scripts.
            3.  **Generate Canva Graphic Idea (ChatGPT):** Creates a prompt for a simple infographic/graphic for Pinterest/Instagram.
            4.  **Log Social Media Drafts (Google Sheets):** Appends the generated social media copy and graphic ideas to a Google Sheet for review.
            5.  **Notify Marketing Team (Email):** Sends an email notification to the marketing team that new drafts are ready for review.
            6.  **Manual Trigger: Log Beta Leads:** A separate manual trigger to log scraped beta user leads into a Google Sheet.

2.  **Community-Led Growth Loop:**
    *   **Action:** Create a free Discord community for users. This will be the hub for feedback, support, and fostering the "Community-Driven Content Library."
    *   **Value:** Offer exclusive content, early access to features, and a "wins" channel where users can share their successful videos.
    *   **Automation:** Use the **MEE6** bot (free tier) on Discord to automate welcome messages, assign roles, and moderate content.

3.  **Product-Led Growth (PLG) Flywheel:**
    *   **Action:** The freemium plan is our most powerful marketing tool. As free users create content, they will naturally spread the word.
    *   **Subtle Watermark:** Add a small, non-intrusive "Made with ClipsCommerce" watermark to videos exported from the free plan.
    *   **In-App Upgrade Prompts:** When a free user hits their usage limit, trigger a modal that clearly explains the benefits of upgrading to the Pro plan.
